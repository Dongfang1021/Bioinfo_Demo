Gene ADA (RefSeq NM_000022.2) coding sequence (CDS) was downloaded from NCBI as FASTA format.
Python script mutant.py was used to get mutated amino acid and codon position in CDS.
Usage
python mutant.py -i cds.fasta -p 239 -m G
Result
The original amino acid is K(Lysine, Lys), codon is AAA
The mutated amino acid is R(Arginine, Arg), codon is AGA
The codon positon is 80
